/* sample code 

Remember an array looks like this:
const teachers = ['Ashley', 'James', 'Guil', 'Treasure', 'Dave'];

An object looks like this:
const apple = {
   type: 'Macintosh',
   color: 'Red'
};

And an array of objects looks like this:

const apples = [
    {
       type: 'Macintosh',
       color: 'Red'
    },
    {
       type: 'Fuji',
       color: 'Green'
    },
];

Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:

quote - a string containing the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.

source - a string containing the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" "Traditional Irish proverb‚Äù or "Anonymous".

citation - optional - a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech, publication, or movie. If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.

year - optional - a number identifying the year of the quote. If there is no known year, do not include this property on the object
